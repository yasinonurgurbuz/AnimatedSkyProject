1 - The lights only in Sun class

2 - Normally, plane tail,wings and engines are grey but for taking lights from up they look like yellow

3 - I could change the color of sun from yellow to black and all obejcts can become black but I confused about grey or black, I mean it can be moon at the same time with grey color. So, I decided grey color. I hope it will not matter.

4 - I couldn't make the part of "Plane hits a bird before the sun sets, give a warning and finish the animation" but I would like to learn how to if we make in class.
